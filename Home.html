            <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>CSS</b> stands for <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heets</li>
                <li>CSS describes <strong>how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,
                    paper, or in other media</strong></li>
                <li>CSS <strong>saves a lot of work</strong>. It can control the layout of
                    multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <li>External stylesheets are stored in <b>CSS files</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
            <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout
                and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>Benefits of Using CSS</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Consistent look and feel to the site.</li>
                <li>With one or two stylesheets you can keep your site colors, fonts, links, and
                    other elements the same throughout your site without having to hard code the
                    same information on each and every page of your site. </li>
                <li>Using CSS saves time.</li>
                <li>While it may take a bit longer for the first page, especially if you are using
                    a WYSIWYG editor to create your HTML you will save time on additional pages.</li>
                <li>You can change the entire look and feel of a site by changing just the
                    stylesheet.</li>
                <li>No need to go through your site page by page to make sure the new &#8216;look&#8217; is
                    applied. &#8211; No more jarring contrasts because you overlooked a page on your
                    redesign.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
            <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
            <p>HTML was
                created to <strong>describe the content</strong> of a web page, like:</p>
            <p>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2
                specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large
                websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single
                page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
            <p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

            <h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
            <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
            <p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>

            <h2>History of HTML</h2>
            <p>CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.</p>
